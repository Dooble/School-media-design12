##### background info 
when making the piece (island) i waned to make a dreamlike surreal painting , i had been thinking about illusions and truth , the impossibility of both, and how truth often exists as an object of aspiration 
to this end i put the island in the sky and had its spires reach into the heavens , filling the work with impossible geometry 
i also wanted to produce an feeling of emptyness and nonconscious desire and struggled a lot with making the spirits look like they were pushing out from the arches at the bottom , continually rotating the center head more and more to make it feel like it was moving  

theme 
	what
		 fairy tales / mundane fantasy 
		 I enjoy antiquated pieces of folklore mainly because they feel like a window into another world rather than a performance , things happen without much discernable reason and often there are stories of great figures and completely mundane events placed in the same collection. 
		 the main thing that I want to produce in my work is that mundanity which feels believable and authentic.
	how developed 
		 unfortunately I feel like I have failed in producing this affect in my most recent work (island) , it lends itself too much to the appearance of an artwork mainly because I took the most banal elements from art nouveau rather than doing the work of finding more appropriate things to incorporate because I wanted the iconographic elements to read so that I could easily say that I had taken artistic influence from the movement. from hereon I will likely stick to diegetic framing as I did in (the forest witch) where the trees serve as border .

research 
	 effectively nothing more than last time , I tend to look at things during ideation and right now I am still in the weeds with the paintings i'm working on. in the future I will try to be more consistent about research and more formal documentation of my development done in sketchbooks. 

artistic influences 
	ghibli- the spirits are very similar to the depictions of noppera-bō in spirited away
	art nouveau - thick outline longer flowing lines and an intricate border 
	graphic art in acrylic marker - don't know if there's a more official name for this but I really like the very subtle gradients and the blockiness and want to incorporate it into the background of (island)

| Technical Skills | Sophisticated, **confident**, innovative use of materials, student has experimented and shown a highly skilled use of techniques, mark making and materials, appropriate use of materials for image and intention of piece. | **Proficient use of materials** and processes. Some experimentation and some innovative use of materials used. Some further exploration combination of materials could add further layers to the piece. | Some good use of materials and experimentation. Further practice to develop technique and use of the materials would be beneficial. | Work is either incomplete or needs more attention to details and technical development of use of materials. |

for some of the sketchbook work I did I started with abstract shapes and then inked on top to make somewhat representational art , could be considered slightly innovative  

I feel like I am confident in the use of materials, maybe to my detriment, and don’t hesitate with making permanent decisions  (that sometimes ruin the work)

| Research, process and compositional strategies | Work is thoroughly documented and supported by sketchbook research, artist, media and idea development. Piece has been meticulously thought through combining original imagery and appropriate materials with a well-balanced, interesting composition, mindful of elements and principles of design. | **Work is well documented** with a good amount of research and **idea development**, resulting in a successful piece. ***More research***, or time on compositional strategies could elevate work even more. | Work is supported by a little research but needs more idea development to bring the piece to a more thoughtful and thorough design. More consideration could be given to composition and the appropriate use of elements and principles of design. | Work is incomplete, or insufficient time has been spent on idea development and compositional strategies. |

 Right now I think the biggest thing I’m lacking is technical skill and intent , typically I am motivated by whether something sounds fun or interesting rather than if it would make sense thematically 

Need to do more research especially in an  academic capacity  

 I do multiple thumbnails and small scale pieces before committing to a composition and explore ideas a decent 

 amount over the course of painting/drawing them
